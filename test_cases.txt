Cases to test with output evidence
/*Testing the correctness of our changes to SimpleDB in maintaining the correct values
for SQL statements and handling the buffer in a more efficient manner than was 
previously implemented*/

//Test SQL statements//



//Test Buffer Behavior//

//Pinning a new block while buffer is empty will place it in buffer 0

//Pinning a new block with non-empty bufferpool containing free space will place new block
//in empty space directly after current pointed-to buffer

//Pinning a new block with a full, all-pinned bufferpool will cause the system to throw
//an error after *100* tries

//Pinning a block that is already in buffer and has its second chance set to false will
//set the second chance to true

//Unpinning a buffer with a pin = 1 will cause the buffer to be replaceable

//Unpinning a buffer with a pin > 1 will cause the buffer to still be pinned

//Pinning a new block in buffer when full, with all buffers unpinned with second chances
//will cause the currently pointed-to buffer to have its second chance removed first and
//subsequently replaced
