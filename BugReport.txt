///Known Bugs///
////////////////

The following bugs can be found in vanilla SimpleDB and have not
been addressed during this project. This list is taken directly
from the README.txt found packaged with SimpleDB:

	* The "*" abbreviation in the select clause is not supported.
    * There are no null values.
    * There are no explicit joins or outer joins in the from clause.
    * The union and except keywords are not supported.
    * Insert statements take explicit values only, not queries.
    * Update statements can have only one assignment in the set clause.
    

Known issue: Inserting the same value into a table with an Extensible
Hash Index may cause the program to crash
Cause: Inserting the same value more times than can be held in a single
block will cause the index to infinitely split.
